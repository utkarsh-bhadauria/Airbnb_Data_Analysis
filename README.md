# üìùProblem Statement
Travel  industries  are  having  important  reflection  of  the  economy  from  past  few  decades,  and  Airbnb 
housing price ranges are of great interest for both Hosts and Traveler. In this project, we are analyzing the 
various aspects with different use cases which covers  many aspects of airbnb listings. It helps in not only 
understanding  the  meaningful  relationships  between  attributes  but  it  also  allows  us  to  do  our  own 
research and come-up with our findings.

The objective of the project is to perform  an exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, data cleaning 
& imputation and at the end, apply different Data Visualization  techniques  to  get the  meaningful insight 
from the given data. This project aims apply some amazing Python Libraries such as Plotly and WordCloud 
which will give a boost to our visual understanding of the data.
